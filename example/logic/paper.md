## Abstract 
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as Wikidata act as a hub of information from multiple domains and disciplines, and is crowdsourced by multiple stakeholders. The vast amount of available information makes it difficult for researchers to manage the entire KG, which is also continually being edited. It is necessary to develop tools that extract subsets for domains of interest. These subsets will help researchers to reduce costs and time, making data of interest more accessible. In the last two BioHackathons (BH20, BH21), we have created prototypes to extract subsets easily applicable to Wikidata, as well as to define a map of the different approaches used to tackle this problem. Building on those outcomes, we aim to enhance subsetting in both definitions using Entity schemas based on Shape Expressions (ShEx) and extraction algorithms, with a special focus on the biomedical domain. Our first aim is to develop complex subsetting patterns based on qualifiers and references for enhancing credibility of datasets. Our second aim is to establish a faster subsetting extraction platform applying new algorithms based on Apache Spark and new tools like a document-oriented DBMS platform.

## Introduction 

Knowledge graphs (KGs) like Wikidata are successfully employed to represent and link
data. Although Wikidata is openly-accessible and editable by anyone, the amount of information captured is continually increasing, making difficult to handle by researches. Therefore, there is a current need to develop extraction subset tools that could make Wikidata knowledge more accesible for domain experts. In previous BioHackathons we have reviewed the functionality and requirements of multiple tools that can be used to create subsets of knowledge graphs (ShEx+slurp, WDumper, WDSub, SparkWDSub, Wikibase dump filter, KGTK). During this BioHackathon we aim to continue exploring the requirements of these tools and establish use-case examples on the biomedical doamin. 

This paper describes the activities that have been done during our participation at [Biohackathon-Europe 2022](https://biohackathon-europe.org/), [project 11](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2022/tree/main/11). The main goal of the project was to create subsets of Wikidata and to analyse those subsets. 
The project is a continnuation from work that started in past hackathons held at Biohackathon 2021 Europe and SWAT4HCLS.

## Activities done during Biohackathon-Europe 2022

### 1 Setup Wdsub library

The [wdsub](https://github.com/weso/wdsub) library was taken as the tool that can generate the subsets. It is [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/wesogroup/wdsub) in docker as a command line tool so in order to run it is only required to have docker installed. 

The library has 2 main inputs: a Wikidata dump in JSON format, and a Shape Expression that describes the contents of the target subset. 

Wikidata dumps can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_download). That page contains a link to the latest dump as well as a link to previous dumps since 2014 from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/wikimediadownloads?and%5B%5D=%22Wikidata%20entity%20dumps%22)

Shape Expressions are based on the [ShEx language](http://shex.io) and describe the RDF serialization from Wikidata. Those Shape Expressions are compatible with the [Entity schemas namespace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_reports/EntitySchema_directory) from Wikidata. The wdsub tool can also use as input WShEx schemas. WShEx is a ShEx variant that is adapted to the Wikibase data model. More information about WShEx can be found at: https://www.weso.es/WShEx/. 

The shape expressions used during the biohackathon are available at this [github repo](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022).


### 2 Creating "hello world" subsets
To evaluate the setup Andra created two shape expressions [gene.shex](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/workflows/wdsub/gene.shex) and [disease.shex](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/workflows/wdsub/disease.shex). The disease shape was written to generate a smaller subset, since the gene shape generated a large subset that was to big to be loaded in a (free-tier) public sparql endpoint on either [data.world](https://data.world) or [TriplyDB](https://triplydb.com), both have limitation in their free tier. However, the resulted disease subset from Wikidata which is 36 Mb (gzipped) was also to big to fit in the free-tier packages. Future work should include finding (affordable) hosting for subsets. 

These two Shape Expressions described both the gene and disease items in Wikidata, by describing the types (ie. using P31 (instance of)) and the relavant identifiers. Not all items on Genes nor Diseases use instance-of (P31) statements. Quite some of those statements are wrongly annotated as such and need further curation. We considered describing these incorrect (negative) patterns (e.g. an item that is annotated as both a gene and a protein), but decided that this is best done post subsetting. The aim of a subset from our perspective is to describe a subset-profile which would extract a subset with high recall. Curation often needs complex queries which time-out on the Wikidata Query Serivce. The curation can subsequently happen as either an additional Shape Expression validation pipeline, or through a designated SPARQL endpoint where the subset included. 

Preliminary results show that WDSub allows describing subset descriptions that allow multiple shapes. This is particularly interesting in Wikidata, where the same concept can be described using different sets of properties or shapes. Here we described genes and diseases using both their types and identifiers, but another example is how in Wikidata ship wrecks are described. Wikidata items on shipwrecks are either annotated using P31 (instance of) Q852190 (shipwreck), or by annotating ships with a statement using P793 (significant event) Q906512 (shipwrecking). 

Identifying all variants of shapes describing a concept within Wikidata is a challenging task, however these shapes on genes and diseases show that we are now able to extract subsets from wikidata using multiple shapes that define a subset.

#### caveat
With the current implementation of wdsub traversing a graph to identifiy a subset is not yet implemented. A use-case where this is needed it the subset of taxonomic clade of lepidoptera, which consists of all butterflies and moths. Extracting subsets on taxonomic clades requires a recursive shape expression. Currently, WDSub does not support recursive shapes. 

This requires a different implementation. WDSub now feeds on the daily dumps of Wikidata. These dumps are concatenated JSON representations of all wikidata items. Traversing wikidata to extract subsets such as the one for all butterflies and moths would require graph traversal which, as said, is not yet implemented in WDSub


### 3 Creating GeneWiki subset 
The biohackathon assisted in an evaluation of existing nodes and edges on drug-target interactions categories within Wikidata. We built machine readable schemas of drug-target interactions in Wikidata for future data reuse ([link](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/examples/ShEx/geneWiki.shex)).

### 4 Creating LIPID MAPS Wikidata subset
During the BioHackathon, one of the use cases formulated to experiment with subsetting was about lipid chemical compounds. LIPID MAPS is a project curating knowledge about lipids and WikiPathways captures knowledge about biological processes. Complementing the information from this curation project with knowledge from Wikidata defines a unique new knowledge graph to support lipidomics research, e.g. in EpiLipidNET.

### 5 Uploading subsets to local SPARQL endpoint
The gene and disease subsets are turtle (RDF) files, which can be stored in any SPARQL endpoint. We have install GraphDB from Ontotext locally to load the generated gene and disease subsets.  


### 6 Analysing the subsets using SPARQL queries

Once the SPARQL endpoint was publicly available, we were able to create several SPARQL queries to analyse if the results were the expected ones. An example SPARQL query is the following, which obtains all medications (Q12140) and counts the links to diseases (Q12136) for which they are the _medical condition treated_ (P2175):

```sparql
prefix rdfs:     <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> 
prefix wd:       <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> 
prefix wdt:      <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> 


SELECT ?x ?xLabel ?countY WHERE {
  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q12140  .
 { select ?x (count(?y) as ?countY) where { 
     ?x wdt:P2175 ?y .
     ?y wdt:P31 wd:Q12136 .
 }} 
            
 Optional { ?x rdfs:label ?xLabel }
 filter(
    lang(?xLabel)='en' 
  )
}
```

The query can [be run online](https://bit.ly/3A5L3o1) and some results:

```csv
"x"                                      ,"xLabel"             ,"countY"
"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q411240" ,"mifepristone"       ,"3"

. . .
```

## Conclusions
- WDSub proved to be able to extract subsets from daily wikidata dumps in an acceptable timeframe (9-12 hours)
- By defining subset profiles that consists of multiple shapes, it is possible to extract high recall subsets from Wikidata. Within Wikidata, with its more then 10k properties, concepts are described using many property sets and graph patterns. By collecting all the possible variations as shapes in a single Shape Expressions file, it is possible to extract high recall subsets from wikidata. 
- Building on the work done in previous hackathon (Both biohackathon and SWAT4HCLS), we now have several subset mechanisms to generate subsets from Wikidata. 

## Future work
- Wikidata subsetting as a service: 
    - We could create a curated list of ShEx/subsets that are regularly generated for specific purposes.
    - Service like WDumper that takes ShEx as input. 
- Evaluation of data quality: 
    -  Investigate the quality of the data (references and qualifiers)
- Integrate extracted subset with other sources:
    - Use extracted subsets as starting points as a seed to create new knowledge graphs, integrating their information with other sources. Example: 1- Map with data from other ontologies, KGs, etc. 2- Use BioSchemas.
- Drug repurpusing: 
    - GeneWiki subset representing drug-target interactions in Wikidata could be used as input to find new uses of drugs. 
 
## Challenges to consider 
- Update online subsets periodically: 
    - Need to update ShEx.
    - Download dumps, and update the subset.
    - We could probably save the ShEx in a github repo and take the latest version from there.

### BioHackathon Notes

In this section we include a report of the daily meetings and discussions that took place during the biohackathon:

### First day: 7th-Nov-2022

- Andra: plan for the week
    - Expectations
        - Finish the paper that we started last year
        - Create subsets for GeneWiki
        - What to do with the subset
            - Issue to solve: Where to store the created subset
                - [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash)
        - Seyed same expectations
        - Expressivity of wdsub is constrained by sequential processing for each line...it checks each item 

Gameplan
* Andra: Revisit the wdsubset of genewiki subgraph
    * This involves support for qualifiers and references


Example of things supported in wdsub:

```
start = @<Gene> OR @<Disease> OR ...

<Gene> EXTRA wdt:P31 {
  wdt:P31   [ wd:Q7187 ....] ;
  # Don't follow this pattern: wdt:P31 . * ;
  wdt:P703  
  
  # References are supported but not validated
  :encodes  @<Protein> ;
  
  # Qualifiers...
  p:P166 { 
    ps:P166  @<Award>         ;
    pq:P585  xsd:dateTime   ? ; 
    pq:P1706 @<Researcher>  *
  } *

}

<Disiease> {

}

<Protein> { 
  wdt:p31 [....]
}
```



```
start = @<Gene_by_ontology> OR @<Gene_by_identifier>

<Gene_by_ontology> {
    p:P31 {
       ps:P31 [wd:Q7187] ;
       prov:wasDerivedFrom . ;
    }
    
    p:P703 {
        ps:P703 [wd:homo sapiens] ;
        prov:wasDerivedFrom . ;
     
    }
}

<Gene_by_identifier> {
    p:
}
```



Seyed's question: What is the difference between these (in terms of extracting subset via WDSub)?:
1)
```
start = @<Gene> OR @<Disease> OR <Protein>

<Gene> EXTRA wdt:P31 {
  wdt:P31   [ wd:Q7187] ;
}

<Disiease> {
    wdt:p31 [wd:Qabc]
}

<Protein> { 
  wdt:p31 [wd:Qijk]
}
```
and 2)
```
start = @<all>

<all> EXTRA wdt:P31 {
  wdt:P31   [ wd:Q7187, wd:Qabc, wd:Qijk] ;
}

```

- Andra: will work on preparing some examples about GeneWiki
- Seyed: Check if the tool finnished and review the output of wdsub.
    - Report about the possible turtle output
- Carolina has some Shape Expressions about GeneWiki (add more properties)
- Labra will continue checking the tool and update docker image

```
run dump -s schema.shex --schemaFormat ShExC -o target/exampleReferences.ttl.gz input.json.gz --dumpMode OnlyMatched --dumpFormat Turtle
```
- During the break I met Egon and were talking about possibility of creating a subset about Chemistry
- Idea: prepare a tutorial to explain how to create subsets using wdsub


### Second day: 8th-Nov-2022

- Seyed: created a subset which contains instances of Genes, Proteins, etc. and put the output (turtle) in a Blazegraph 
    - Dumps from: 3 January 2022 [Link]( https://academictorrents.com/details/229cfeb2331ad43d4706efd435f6d78f40a3c438)
    - SPARQL counting: 
        - Gene: 1196517
        - Protein: 987614
        - Chemical compound: 1244866
        - Disease: 5512
- Andra [created an example](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/examples/ShEx/gene.shex) of a ShEx to extract info related with Genes but that is more inclusive than just checking the P31 Q7187, including all things that have at least some specific properties...

```
<Gene> @<TypedGene> OR @<PropertyBasedGene>

<TypedGene> EXTRA p:P31 {
  p:P31 { ps:P31 [wd:Q7187]} 
}

<PropertyBasedGene> 
  { p:P351 { ps:P351 . } +  OR 
  { p:P353 { ps:P353 . } + OR 
  . . .
}

```

- Ammar is planning to work on a subset related with lipids using a ShEx like the following:

```

Carolina: 
- Create a subset based on her [ShEx] expressions ([link](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/examples/ShEx/geneWiki.shex))
- Review JSON structure of the subsets 
- Once we get the subset, apply some Machine Learning algorithms for Link prediction
- We started to run wdsub using Carolina's ShEx which contains information about GeneWiki. The shape we used was [this one](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/examples/ShEx/geneWiki.shex)
- [Link to some past results from Labra's students]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mxEo6y4IJjVpDK1nT2PvcvkFgvTCLBJax6WipTMXCUM/edit#heading=h.9ywt0nihccfc)

        - 14 hours more or less
        - 610Mb
    - Detect problems in wikidata
        - taxon is not a taxon but a taxon name

        -  We could wrap it into a web service. It would be great to have a server host as WDumper: https://wdumps.toolforge.org/dumps
    -  Several options discussed: 
        -  Command line
        -  Generic web service
        -  Pre-defined subsets: Fixed set of curated shape expressions, cron job to run that service...
        - Wikidata + quality control 
- Other tools apart from wdsub
    - Ammar reminds that he created a subset for lipids using pyshex and slurper

### Fourth day 10th-Nov-2022
- Labra 
    - Published dataset about GeneWiki in Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7309739
    - Waiting for the other subsets that are being generated: more than 20hours...don't know why

- Ammar
    - Created a subset with lipids using the WholeEntity and this [Shape Expression](https://github.com/kg-subsetting/biohackathon2022/blob/main/workflows/wdsub-lipids/lipids.shex) 
        - 1.6Gb gzipped, 8.4Gb unzipped
        - Trying to guess if the problem is the OR in the ShEx that seems to ignore the first part...maybe update to version 0.0.29 of wdsub could solve it.
        - We are going to create a new subset using this simplified ShEx
        - Ammar will help publishing the Zenodo dataset in Turtle in a public SPARQL endpoint with a given IP so we can do SPARQL queries on it...

- Seyed
    - Script to count number of instance between WDF and WDSub but it didn't work
        - Trying to check which items were extraced by one and not the other...
        - One was created with C and the other with Blazegraph
        - 600 items in wdf that are not in wdsub
        - Carolina will try to help there
- Carolina
    - Waiting for the JSON results to analyze them using some link prediction algorithms...
    - Started to look at processing turtle rdflib
    - Will take a look at the differences reported by Seyed and the Python code
    - RDF2vec library could be used for this: http://rdf2vec.org/
    - Q. How is the embedding happening?
        - Random walks...random visits of the nodes.
        - Train neural network with those connections.
        - Principal components labelled with the class.
        - One issue could be to rewrite from wdt:P31 to rdf:type
        - Fact validation with KG embeddings: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2456/paper33.pdf
        - Semantic Answer Type prediction (ISWC 2020-2021): http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2774/paper-05.pdf, http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3119/paper7.pdf

Ammar took the GeneWiki subset previously generated and published it a Virtuoso TripleStore with a public SPARQL endpoint. After that, we were able to create several SPARQL queries to analyse the extracted subset. 

- We were discussing about the publication of the results of the biohackathon and decided the following:
    - Publish biohackarxiv report of last year's which we had left as a draft unpublished in the next weeks
    - Try to publish a first draft of the biohackarxiv report tomorrow.

- We started a discussion about possible reproducibility pipelines
    - Embed docker invocation in a Jupyter notebook. This option requires infrastructure to host the Jupyter notebooks.
    - Embed a Jupyter notebook in a docker container. This is possible using [DataScience Notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook).
    - Another possibility could be to use a Workflow language like [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
